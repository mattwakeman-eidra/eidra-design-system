"@eidra/react": minor

Migrate from the retired `@base-ui-components/react@1.0.0-rc.0` to the renamed, actively-maintained `@base-ui/react@^1.5.0`. The old package was frozen at a release candidate and deprecated ("renamed to @base-ui/react"); this moves onto stable 1.x. Import paths were renamed across all components and ref type annotations updated for Base UI 1.5's stricter element typings. No component API or styling changes. Note: per Base UI's stable release, unchecked Checkbox/Switch no longer submit an "off" value in forms unless `uncheckedValue` is set.
