### Minor Changes

- 9777af6: Add `Breadcrumbs` — a breadcrumb trail showing the path to the current page. Renders semantic `<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb">` → `<ol>` with the current page marked `aria-current="page"`. Links are plain `<a>` by default, or pass an item `render` callback to use a router link without coupling the design system to a router. Labels accept nodes (icons) and the separator is customizable (defaults to `/`).
- 3aadd76: Add `DataGrid` (and the `EditableNumberCell` companion) — a generic, config-driven data grid built on a native `<table>`: sticky pinned columns, a multi-tier header from column groups, click-to-sort, global filtering, column visibility, expandable tree rows, and a sticky totals footer. `EditableNumberCell` provides click-to-edit numeric cells with override/aggregate markers. The grid's `accent="finance"` scopes interactive affordances to the finance data-viz palette.
- 05d9e43: Add `EmptyState` — a centered placeholder for empty lists, tables, and search results. Composes an optional icon, a title, supporting description, and an optional actions slot (e.g. a primary `Button`). Has `sm`/`md` sizes so it fits both full pages and compact containers like a `DataGrid` body.
- c9b45e9: Add `SaveIndicator` (and the `useSaveIndicator` hook) — a transient inline confirmation that fades in after a successful save and out again, standardised for inline-edit interactions (pairs with `DataGrid` cell editing). Renders an `aria-live` status region so the save is announced to assistive tech; supports an optional visible label or icon-only display.
- 109d928: Add `Statistic` — a single labelled metric (uppercase label, prominent value, optional trailing delta, caption, and progress bar). The reusable building block for KPI bars and stat-card grids: compose several with `Separator` for a row or `Card` for a grid. Threshold/colour logic stays with the caller via the `tone` prop; the optional progress bar composes the `Progress` component.
